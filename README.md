## Installation

### iOS

The Infinitum SDK can be added to the project using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/).

First you have to add Cocoapods to your project. Simply go to the terminal, navigate to your project folder and type
the following command:

```
 pod init
```

Then go to the generated Podfile and add the following pod:

```ruby
 pod 'InfinitumSDKMobile'
```

By default, the latest version will be used.

*Note that there is no support for emulators as of yet.*

### Android

An android application that uses Java requires a few configurations before being able to use Infinitum.
Since Infinitum is a multiplatform library that uses Kotlin, it becomes necessary for your application to enable Kotlin. 
The easiest way to accomplish this is to create a random Kotlin file in your project. Then, the Android Studio IDE will prompt you to configure Kotlin. Press 'configure', then 'All modules containing Kotlin files' and wait for the project to sync.
The second step is to add the following lines to your application build.gradle, inside the android task:
```Groovy
compileOptions {
	sourceCompatibility = '1.8'
        targetCompatibility = '1.8'
}
```
This will allow your application to use Java 1.8 which introduces lambdas to java. This allows us to use functions as callbacks.

#### To import the Infinitum SDK to your project you will need to:

1. Add the [Jitpack repository](https://jitpack.io/#infinitum-dev/mobile-sdk) to your project build.gradle file
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
2. Add the SDK dependency to your application build.gradle file:
```groovy
dependencies {
	implementation('com.github.infinitum-dev:mobile-sdk:latest-version@aar') {
		transitive = true
	}
}
```

3. Sometimes the build may fail because of duplicate META-INF files. To solve this issue simply add the following lines to the android task in your application build.gradle file:

```groovy
packagingOptions {
	exclude 'META-INF/*.kotlin_module'
}
```

---

## Usage

Every call to our API requires two callbacks, onSuccess and onFailure. The onSuccess lambda will require different parameters depending on the method being called. For example config will require a lambda that receives a [ConfigResponse](#ConfigResponse) object, doInit will require a [InitResponse](#InitResponse), etc. On the other hand, onFailure will always require a lambda with an [ErrorResponse](#ErrorResponse) parameter.

Infinitum has various modules that accomplish different goals. To use these modules you need to initialize the sdk by using:

[iOS](#iOS-1) [Android Kotlin](#Android---Kotlin) [Android Java](#Android---Java)

### iOS

```Swift
let infinitum = Infinitum.Companion().getInstance(applicationContext: ApplicationContext())
infinitum.config(
	domain: "demo.infinitum.app", 
	appType: "biometric-clock", 
	onSuccess: { (response) in self.doInit(configResponse: response)}, 
	onFailure: { (error) in print(error) })
```
```Swift
func doInit(configResponse: ConfigResponse) {
        infinitum.doInit(
		domain: "demo.infinitum.app", 
		appToken: configResponse.apps.first?.token ?? "default",
		onSuccess: photo, //Another way to send a lambda
		onFailure: {(error) in print(error)}),
		eventBuilder: NodeEvent.NodeEventBuilder().addEvent(event: "device-licensed", onEvent: {() in print("LICENSED")}))
}
```
Since this is a multiplatform SDK and we require android apps to send their Context, it was necessary to create a class called ApplicationContext with different implementations for iOS and Android. The iOS implementation does not require any parameters.

After initialization the SDK will remember your session so you don't need to repeat these steps every time your application starts.

All the modules are available through the Infinitum class.
Here's an example that utilizes Auth's module photo method:

```Swift
func photo() {
	let image = UIImage(imageLiteralResourceName: "resource")
        let image64 = ImageUtils().convertImageToBase64(image: image)
        
    	infinitum.auth()?.photo(
		photoB64: image64, 
		onSuccess: {(response) in print(response)}, 
		onFailure: {(error) in print(error)})
}
```

### Android - Kotlin

```Kotlin
infinitum = Infinitum.Companion.getInstance(ApplicationContext(baseContext))
infinitum.config(
	"demo.infinitum.app",
        "Biometric-clock",
	onSuccess = ::doInit,
	onFailure = { error ->
                //error handling
                Log.d(TAG, error.toString())
	})
```

```Kotlin
fun doInit(configResponse: ConfigResponse) {
	val app = configResponse.apps[0]

        infinitum.init(
            domain = "demo.infinitum.app",
            appToken = app.token,
            onSuccess = ::countUsers,
            onFailure = ::onError,
            eventBuilder = NodeEvent.NodeEventBuilder().
                addEvent("device-licensed", { println("----------LICENSED----------")}).
                addEvent("device-unlicensed", {println("----------UNLICENSED----------")})
        )
}
```
Since this is a multiplatform SDK and we require android apps to send their Context, it was necessary to create a class called ApplicationContext with different implementations for iOS and Android. The Android implementation requires the context to be sent as a parameter.

After initialization the SDK will remember your session so you don't need to repeat these steps every time your application starts.

All the modules are available through the Infinitum class.
Here's an example that utilizes App's module getAppById method:

```Kotlin
fun getAppById(initResponse: InitResponse) {
	infinitum.apps()?.getAppById(
		40,
            	onSuccess = { app ->
                	println(app)
            	},
            	onFailure = { errorResponse ->
                	Log.d(TAG, errorResponse.toString())
            	})
}
```

### Android - Java

```Java
Infinitum infinitum = Infinitum.Companion.getInstance(new ApplicationContext(this));
infinitum.config(
	"demo.infinitum.app",
	"biometric-clock",
	this::configSuccess,
	this::error
);
```

```Java
private Unit configSuccess(ConfigResponse response) {
	infinitum.init(
                "demo.infinitum.app",
                response.getApps().get(0).getToken(),
                this::initSuccess,
                errorResponse -> {
                    Log.d(TAG, errorResponse.toString());
                    return Unit.INSTANCE;
                }
        );
        return Unit.INSTANCE;
}
```
Note that all the functions that sent as a parameter (callbacks) need to end with return Unit.INSTANCE. This is because Kotlin doesn't have Void like Java, but Unit is basically the same thing.

Since this is a multiplatform SDK and we require android apps to send their Context, it was necessary to create a class called ApplicationContext with different implementations for iOS and Android. The Android implementation requires the context to be sent as a parameter.

After initialization the SDK will remember your session so you don't need to repeat these steps every time your application starts.

All the modules are available through the Infinitum class.
Here's an example that utilizes Auth's module photo method:

```Java
private Unit photo(InitResponse response) {
	Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.resource);

        String image = ImageUtils.INSTANCE.convertImageToBase64(bitmap);

        infinitum.auth().photo(
                image,
                photoResponse -> {
                    System.out.println(photoResponse.toString());
                    return Unit.INSTANCE;
                },
                errorResponse -> {
                    System.out.println(errorResponse.toString());
                    return Unit.INSTANCE; });

        return Unit.INSTANCE;
}
```

### Utils

Contains functions that will help you save time.  

```Kotlin
   	fun convertImageToBase64(image: Image): String {
```
image - Image that will be converted to Base64 format. On iOS this method requires an UIImage, on Android this method receives a Bitmap.
